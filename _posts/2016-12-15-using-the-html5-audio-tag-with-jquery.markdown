### Description
To create a HTML5 web player using jQuery and audio tag. In fact, using jQuery is completely optional. It just ensures compatibility for different browsers and simplifies the javascript syntax. This article assumes basic knowledge of HTML and jQuery/javascript.

### Background
Due to my lack of project updates (because I am working on one, but it won't be finished for a while), I will try updating my blog by writing some tutorials every now and then. This is a problem that came up while I was making the [Spotify Explorer app]({{ site.url }}/projects/SpotifyExplorer), which you can check out with the link.

### Walkthrough
#### Step 1: Preparing the HTML file
You would start out with a HTML page, below is the one I usually use. You can either use jQuery on Google CDN or download it and refer locally.

{% highlight html linenos %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
    <title>Your very own web MP3 player!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

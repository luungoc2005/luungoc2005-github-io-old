It is finally the year 2017.

I have never been the kind of person to do new year resolutions. Even though it is a good thing to do, in the sense that you get to review personal objectives and achievements. As frequent as I update my blog posts, however, I tend to get distracted by a lot of things.

If you do follow my Github repo, you might find that I should be working on the following:
+ The HTML5 audio tag tutorial on this blog
+ The color picker using Bootstrap

There is also a markdown editor, with basically just the boilerplate code at the moment. It is essentially a to-do list item which I might never finish.

So why are those pending for so long? basically I am, at this moment, no longer interested in web front-end programming. While I may regain interest in the future, I am now all crazy for some statistics and machine-learning with Accord.NET or AForge.NET. While .NET is not exactly a great platform for this kind of stuff, it is a language I am familiar with. After all, I was able to build a simple - but fully functional and user friendly analytical piece of software in half a day, a feat I could not have done in any other languages.

I might write a later blog post on my own findings and experiences within the last 2 weeks (it was _thrilling_, to say the least). But for now, it is also a good time to remind myself that I still do have somewhat an obligation to maintain this blog. I am just going to leave the two above projects as pending, which I might get back to after I finish everything I want to do.

For now, I will get back to my little experiments at hand and maybe document a little in the upcoming weeks.

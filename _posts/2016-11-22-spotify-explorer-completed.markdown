Spotify Explorer is now (tentatively) completed. Actually, that just means finishing the long-overdue popular tracks function. I might want to limit the number of popular tracks to 5 though for aesthetics, but it is still 10 for now.

Anyway, despite stating that it is completed, I still have a number of aesthetics and code change in mind, in particular prettifying the code (it is an absolutely horifying, unmaintainable mess right now), and adding popups of detailed information for each popular track. I also want to add an options dialog for volume control and the likes.

As a long shot, this app can also be upgraded by using Authentication to access user's preferences or directly add tracks to user playlist. However this definitely won't happen until Spotify is actually available in Vietnam so I can buy a subscription and test it. The app can also be updated to record popular searches, but this also takes much effort that I simply don't have the time for.

Hopefully I will find the time to do it in the next few busy weeks though, my schedule is now packed with very boring and unawesome work. I have so many responsibilities and developing this site is among my lowests of priorities. It's frustrating, too, I have a ton of ideas for this app and others in mind. This should last only 2-3 weeks, hopefully, unless something else come up.

Until then, it might take some time for the next update, but the app should be usable at least by now. Give it a try!

*Update: Minutes after this post, I added fade in/out function for the audio player, because it is jarring listening to audio previews without. That will be the last function in a while I guess.*

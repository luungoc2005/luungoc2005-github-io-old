I will start to upload some older projects from time to time. Granted, I did lose a lot of work from since when I started programming, thanks to some untimely hard drive failure (2 times, at that). Also, only a few of my recent works are actually web-compatible. But this may also be a chance for me to revisit my old desktop apps and cringe at my poor coding back then, maybe improve upon them if I feel like it. Should be fun.

To start off, "To-do List" is a recent assignment from an online course I was taking, feel free to have a look at it at the [Projects](/projects/) page.

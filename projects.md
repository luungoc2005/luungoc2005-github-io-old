### Spotify Explorer
An artist explorer app for Spotify, making use of Spotify Web API for search, suggestions and track samples.
A good way to pass a few minutes. I myself found a few favorite tracks while testing it.
Does not support sample track playing on mobile, thanks to mobile browsers not having support for HTML5 media (*yet*). There are workarounds, but it will take a while to implement and I still lack the means to test on iOS.

First working version on 19 November, 2016
Lasted update 23 November, 2016

### To-do list using jQuery and Local Storage
This is essentially a copy of [this tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/building-list-jquery-local-storage/) as part of an assignment for an online course I attend. Below are some few modification I made

 + Upgrade to jQuery 3 instead of jQuery 1.1 dependency (I just feel like it)
 + Added Owner field
 + (Bug fix) Making tasks stay on top when dragged
 + (Feature) Change text color for overdue tasks
 + (Feature) CSS style tweaks, description can have multiple lines

Known issues:
 + Ordering of task items are not saved
 
I no longer maintain this project. However the repo can be found on my github.

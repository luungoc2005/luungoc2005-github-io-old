Hello, and welcome to my (tentative) personal site.

My name is Nguyễn Lưu Ngọc. I am a Vietnamese web developer-wannabe living in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam with a passion for art and technology. My first published program was written in 2006, a file split/merging desktop application, which found use at the time due to the limited storage of portable devices. I am also proficient with Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator for digital design, particularly websites, logos and posters. More information can be found through [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luungoc2005).

Other than work, I also have a passion for crafting handmade products, particularly Origami, and the Piano.

Feel free to also have a look at the Projects section of the site for some of my more recent works.

In a nutshell, he is a Vietnamese web developer-wannabe living in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam with a passion for art and technology. his first published program was written in 2006, a file split/merging desktop application, which found use at the time due to the limited storage of portable devices. He is also proficient with Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator for digital design, particularly websites, logos and posters. More information can be found through [his LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luungoc2005).

Other than work, He also has a passion for crafting handmade products, particularly Origami, and the Piano.
